Planning
Generate Bomb locations
Generate grid
     Empty or bomb
Click
     Bomb = Game over
     Empty = square change colour

Planning extra feature - how many bombs nearby
Need:
     1) way to look up cell number and what's in the cell
     2) count the number of bombs surrounding clicked cell
     3) display the number on clicked cell

1) way to look up cell number and what's in the cell
Adding object of whats inside each cell

2) count the number of bombs surrounding clicked cell
When cell clicked, looks up bomb object to count number of bombs nearby.
Scenarios - cell clicked is:
     middle
     edge
     corner

Current flow:
     Start of game: 
            game board made, 
            each cell has event listener
            each cell has unique ID (0-99)
     click cell
         checks whether cell contains bomb
               - if yes -> game over: losing screen 
               - if no 
                    checks bombs in all nearby cells. 
                    returns a number representing number of nearby bombs
                    checks if current score = max score. If yes, game over: winning screen
                    adds square to cells clicked array

Want to add: feature/ if cell has no bombs nearby, all nearby cells are automatically clicked
Need: 
- separate CSS class to differentiate manually clicked and automatically clicked cell
- function to check if nearby cells have been clicked already
               if yes -> nothing
               if no -> "click it" 


Current functions: 
- handleClick 
     - this defines variables id and cell 
     - checks if bomb space contains bomb
          - if yes -> end game
          - if no -> passes to EmptyCellClicked and updates Score, removes eventlistener
- handleEmptyCellClicked
     -
